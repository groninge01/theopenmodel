        An independent football prediction project that explains what each
        number means and keeps both correct and incorrect past results visible.
      </p>

      <h2>Where this started</h2>
      <p>
        The Open Model began as an{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/Hicruben/world-cup-2026-prediction-model">
          open-source World Cup 2026 prediction model
        </a>
        . It compares team strength, estimates possible scores and turns those
        scores into a chance of each match result. Through 15 July 2026, its top
        pick was correct in <b>70 of 102 completed matches</b>, and it
        identified all four semi-finalists before the quarter-finals. The
        tournament record is still being updated at{' '}
        <a href="https://cup26matches.com">cup26matches.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then adapted the same type of score-probability framework for club
        football, using European club-strength ratings. This site covers
        Europe&apos;s top five leagues. The club model starts its own results
        history when the 2026–27 league season begins in August.
      </p>

      <h2>Who runs it</h2>
      <p>
        The Open Model is an independent project run by one developer. AI tools
        may help draft analysis, but match percentages come from the statistical
        model rather than a language model. Important factual claims are checked
        against current sources before publication. There is no bookmaker
        sponsor and no promise of guaranteed wins.
      </p>

      <h2>The rules we can&apos;t break</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Predictions are published before kickoff.</b> The public World Cup
        repository and archive provide a checkable publication trail for the
        international model.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Incorrect results stay visible.</b> A result given a 70% chance still
        does not happen about three times in ten. When a top pick is wrong, it
        remains on the <Link href="/record/">past-results page</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The method is explained.</b> The{' '}
        <Link href="/guide/">beginner&apos;s guide</Link> explains the
        percentages, while the{' '}
        <Link href="/methodology/">technical methodology</Link> documents the
        calculations. Current club outputs can be inspected in the{' '}
        <Link href="/data/">data downloads</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Probabilities, not tips.</b> We estimate what may happen. We do not
        sell picks or promise wins, and the site should not be treated as
        betting advice.
      </p>

      <h2>Data &amp; sources</h2>
      <p>
        Team-strength ratings come from <a href="http://clubelo.com">ClubElo</a>
        . Scheduled matches, standings, squads and player statistics come from{' '}
        <a href="https://www.football-data.org">football-data.org</a>. Live
        scores and match events will come from Sportmonks when that feed is
        active. News headlines are attributed and linked to the original
        publisher. Check the relevant download or repository for its specific
        reuse terms.
